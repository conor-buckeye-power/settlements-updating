### Files that need to be downloaded prior to running (list in-progress)
- None so far

### Get MISO LMPs
- Select a month and year for the LMP retriever to run on
- The program will iterate from 1 to 31 checking to see if cell **A4** is empty or not
- If cell **A4** *is* empty then the program will begin pulling LMPs for that date
